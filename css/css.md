# CSS Layout system
    - CSS has it's default layout system to create your page more dynamic and outstanding.
    * Floats
        - Floating an element changes the behavior of that element and the block level elements that follow it in normal flow. The floated element is moved to the left or right and removed from normal flow, and the surrounding content floats around it.
            
                The float property has four possible values:
                * left — Floats the element to the left.
                * right — Floats the element to the right.
                * none — Specifies no floating at all. This is the default value.
                * inherit — Specifies that the value of the float property should be inherited from the     element's parent element.
    * Grid Layout
        - A CSS layout system that allows developers to arrange content in rows and columns. It's a  two-dimensional layout that uses a structure of intersecting horizontal and vertical lines called grid lines.
        
    * Flexbox
        - Flexbox is the short name for the Flexible Box Layout CSS module, designed to make it easy for us to lay things out in one dimension — either as a row or as a column. To use flexbox, you apply display: flex to the parent element of the elements you want to lay out; all its direct children then become flex items.
    * Column layout
        - A layout method that can be used in multi-column, flexible box, and grid layouts.

    * The position property 
        — Allows you to precisely control the placement of boxes inside other boxes. static positioning is the default in normal flow, but you can cause elements to be laid out differently using other values, for example, as fixed to the top of the browser viewport.
